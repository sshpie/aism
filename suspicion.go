// suspicion is a phi-accrual-style detector for how the target host is
// answering aism. It is adapted from the distributed-systems failure
// detector of Hayashibara et al. (2004) — the same detector Cassandra and Akka
// use to decide a cluster node has gone down.
//
// A fixed RTT threshold is brittle. Set it tight and a naturally jittery host
// trips it constantly; set it loose and a rock-steady host can degrade a long
// way before it fires. The phi-accrual detector removes the guess: it LEARNS
// the distribution of how the host normally answers, from a sliding window of
// samples, and scores every new observation on a continuous logarithmic
// surprise scale, phi:
//
//	phi = -log10( P(an honest response is at least this slow) )
//
// phi = 1  -> roughly a 10%  chance the host is merely slow, not stressed.
// phi = 2  -> roughly a 1%   chance.
// phi = 3  -> roughly a 0.1% chance.
//
// Because the distribution is re-estimated every probe, the detector adapts on
// its own: a jittery host earns a wide tolerance, a steady host a tight one.
// aism reads a rising phi as the host turning hostile and slows down before
// any hard cutoff is reached.
