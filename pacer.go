// Pacer is aism's congestion-control engine. It treats a stealth assessment
// as a flow to be rate-controlled, and combines two bodies of theory.
//
// From TCP congestion control:
//
//   - TCP Vegas — delay-gradient sensing. Vegas watches round-trip time and
//     reads a rising RTT as a queue building, slowing down BEFORE a packet is
//     dropped. aism does the same: a host whose answers are slowing is
//     starting to throttle us, and aism backs off proactively.
//
//   - TCP Reno — multiplicative decrease. A lost probe (a silent drop, or a
//     RST) is treated like a lost segment: the probe rate is cut hard.
//
// aism deliberately does NOT take slow start from TCP. A bulk transfer ramps
// up exponentially because it wants to find the bandwidth ceiling fast. A
// stealth probe wants the opposite — to never touch the ceiling. So the
// control variable here is an inter-probe INTERVAL, the inverse of TCP's
// congestion window: it grows when cwnd would shrink, starts cautious, and
// only earns speed.
//
// From distributed-systems failure detection:
//
//   - The phi-accrual detector (see suspicion.go) replaces what would
//     otherwise be a fixed "RTT is too high" threshold. Vegas knew RTT was
//     rising; phi-accrual knows, against a LEARNED distribution of the host's
//     own behaviour, how surprising that rise is. The pacer's slow-down and
//     speed-up decisions are driven by that suspicion score, so the controller
//     adapts to a jittery host and a steady host without retuning.
